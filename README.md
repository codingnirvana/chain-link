# Chain Link Game

Chain Link Game is a simple and fun web-based word game where players must guess the next word in a chain of related words. The goal is to create the longest chain of connected words based on common phrases.

## How to Play

- The game starts with a given word.
- Your task is to guess the next word that completes the phrase with the current word.
- For example, if the starting word is "Coffee", a possible answer could be "Date" to form "Coffee Date".
- If you guess correctly, the game continues with a new word.
- You have **5 lives**, and each incorrect guess will cost you a life.
- Hints are provided after each incorrect guess, showing more of the word until you guess correctly or run out of lives.

## Features

- **Hints**: As you make incorrect guesses, you will receive hints, revealing the first letters of the correct answer.
- **Lives**: You start with 5 lives, and the game ends when you run out of lives.
- **Victory Message**: If you correctly guess the entire chain, you receive a congratulatory message.
- **Game Over**: When you lose all your lives, the complete word chain is shown, with missed words highlighted in red.
